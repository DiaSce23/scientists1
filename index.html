            <em>I do not know what I may appear to the world...</em><br><br>...but to myself I seem to have been only
            like a boy playing on
            the sea-shore, and diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a prettier shell than
            ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay all undiscovered before me.

        <div><em>Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market</em><br><br>Tesla conducted a range of
            experiments with
            mechanical oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray imaging. He also built a
            wirelessly controlled boat, one of the first ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and
            demonstrated his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his lab, and was noted for his

        <h1>Albert Einstein</h1>
        <div>31879-1955</div>
        <img src="Einstein.jpg" alt="">
        <div> <em>Einstein was born at Ulm, in Württemberg, Germany, on March 14, 1879.</em><br><br>Six weeks later the
            family moved to Munich,
            where he later on began his schooling at the Luitpold Gymnasium. Later, they moved to Italy and
            Albert continued his education at Aarau, Switzerland and in 1896 he entered the Swiss Federal Polytechnic
            School in Zurich to be trained as a teacher in physics and mathematics. In 1901, the year he gained his
            diploma, he acquired Swiss citizenship and, as he was unable to find a teaching post, he accepted a position
            as technical assistant in the Swiss Patent Office. In 1905 he obtained his doctor’s degree.
